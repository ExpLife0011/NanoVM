# NanoVM
PoC lightweight x64 VM implementation

NanoVM is register based VM which also implements stack memory. The project also includes assembler with similiar syntax to x86 asm with intel syntax. Size of single instruction varies from 1 to 2 bytes + immediate value (up to 64 bit aka 8 bytes) if used. Opcode is encoded with 5 bits which limits the amount of different instructions to 32. Currently used opcodes (these might change when the project matures):

```Mov,
Add,
Sub,
And,
Or,
Xor,
Sar,
Sal,
Ror,

Mul,
Div,
