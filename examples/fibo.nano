;This code will print fibonacci sequence
;use reg0 and reg1 for storing numbers
;set reg3 as counter for how many pairs should be printed
mov reg3, 10
;set reg1 to 1
mov reg1, 1
;label could be placed here
printi reg0
add reg0, reg1
printi reg1
add reg1, reg0
dec reg3 ;subtract 1 from reg3
cmp reg3, reg5 ; compare to 0 (reg5 is initialized as 0)
